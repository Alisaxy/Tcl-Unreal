# Tcl/Unreal
Version 1.0 released! This means it's ready for production.
Updated docs are coming, the interface is very simple however.
There is a TclComponent and it has a bind templated method,
a define templated method, a pack templated method and a BP
exposed Eval method together with experimental and advanced deconstructors.
That's it!
